   <title>Resteasy Caching Features</title>
   
   <para>
   Client and server side caching facilities are Resteasy specific extensions of JAX-RS, and they each
   work differently in Resteasy 2 and Resteasy 3.
   </para>

   <title>Client side</title>
   
   <para>
   Resteasy 3 offers the same client side cache facility as Resteasy 2, but it is enabled differently,
   by way of <classname>org.jboss.resteasy.client.jaxrs.cache.BrowserCacheFeature</classname>, which
   implements the JAX-RS 2.0 class <classname>javax.ws.rs.core.Feature</classname>:
   </para>
   
   <programlisting>
Client client = ClientBuilder.newClient();
String url = "http://localhost:8081/orders/{id}";
ResteasyWebTarget target = (ResteasyWebTarget) client.target(url);
BrowserCacheFeature cacheFeature = new BrowserCacheFeature();
target.register(cacheFeature);
String rtn = target.resolveTemplate("id", "1").request().get(String.class);
   </programlisting>
   
   <para>
   Client side caching also works for proxies:
   </para>
   
   <programlisting>
@Path("/orders")
public interface OrderServiceClient
{
   @Path("{id}")
   @GET
   @Produces("application/xml")
   public Order getOrder(@PathParam("id") String id);
}
...
Client client = ClientBuilder.newClient();
String "http://localhost:8081";
ResteasyWebTarget target = (ResteasyWebTarget) client.target(url);
BrowserCacheFeature cacheFeature = new BrowserCacheFeature();
target.register(cacheFeature);
OrderServiceClient orderService = target.proxy(OrderServiceClient.class);
   </programlisting>

   </sect1>
   
   <sect1 id="server_cache">
   <title>Server side</title>
   
   <para>
   As in Resteasy 2, a server side caching facility that sits in front of JAX-RS resources is made available
   in Resteasy 3, but the default underlying cache in Resteasy 3 is Infinispan, which supercedes the JBoss Cache
   project. It is highly configurable, and the documentation should be consulted for additional information:
   <ulink url="http://infinispan.org/documentation/">http://infinispan.org/documentation/</ulink>.
   </para>
   
   <para>
   Server side caching is also enabled differently. Resteasy 3 uses the JAX-RS 2.0
   <classname>javax.ws.rs.core.Feature</classname> facility, in the form of
   <classname>org.jboss.resteasy.plugins.cache.server.ServerCacheFeature</classname>, which should be
   registered via the <classname>javax.ws.rs.core.Application.</classname>
   </para>
