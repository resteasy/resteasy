   Validation is yet another facility that appeared as an ad hoc extension in RESTEasy 2 and
   was later formalized in JAX-RS 2.0. In RESTEasy 2, validation was implemented in the 
   resteasy-hibernatevalidator-provider module, and it was necessary to annotate classes and/or methods
   with <classname>@ValidateRequest</classname> to enable validation.

   <para>
   In RESTEasy 3, validation is implemented in the resteasy-validator-provider-11 module, and
   <classname>@ValidateRequest</classname> is no longer relevant. In fact, validation is enabled
   by default, as long as resteasy-validator-provider-11 is on the classpath.

   <para>
   In RESTEasy 3.7, the resteasy-validator-provider-11 has been renamed to resteasy-validator-provider.
