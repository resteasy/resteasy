Example of using RestEasy with:
- Hibernate
- Hibernate Annotations
- Spring
- Jetty (embedded)
- In memory HSQLDB 
- MySQL as a possible replacement to HSQLDB

System Requirements:
====================
- Maven 2.0.9 or higher

07/07/08 Updated:
================

Added client module. The module shows an example to test the existing war generated by the service module using the same
web container: jetty6 in an embedded mode. The container is injected in the junit 4 test. The client makes use of the resteasy client framework.

Building the project:
====================

mvn clean install

Running the project and manually testing it:
===========================================

cd services
mvn jetty:run

Open a browser at the following URL:

List all available contacts in database:
http://localhost:9095/services/contactservice/contacts

List a contact by Id (among the list of the previously returned list):
http://localhost:9095/services/contactservice/contacts/1
OR
http://localhost:9095/services/contactservice/contacts/2
OR
http://localhost:9095/services/contactservice/contacts/3

List the contacts of contacts:
http://localhost:9095/services/contactservice/contacts/1/contacts
OR
http://localhost:9095/services/contactservice/contacts/2/contacts
OR
http://localhost:9095/services/contactservice/contacts/3/contacts

(Optional) Switch HSQLDB to MySQL:
==================================

MySQL must be installed and accessible.
The maven 2 build process creates and initializes a new database instance.
As privileges must be given to do so, the following files MUST be changed prior building the project with the command: mvn install

- persistence/src/main/sql/mysql/initialize.bat: 

Replace <MYSQL_USER> with the MySQL user that has privileges to create a database
        <MYSQL_PASSWORD> with the user's associated password
The file contains the following lines:
	mysql -u<MYSQL_USER> -p<MYSQL_PASSWORD> < dbschema.sql
	mysql -u<MYSQL_USER> -p<MYSQL_PASSWORD> < data.sql


- persistence/src/main/resources/db.properties

Replace <MYSQL_USER> with the MySQL user that has privileges to create a database
        <MYSQL_PASSWORD> with the user's associated password
Possibly the database URL if the MySQL instance has been configured on a different machine:

The file contains the following lines:
	mzt.db.username=<MYSQL_USER>
	mzt.db.password=<MYSQL_PASSWORD>
	mzt.db.driver=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
	mzt.db.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/contact?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=UTF-8
