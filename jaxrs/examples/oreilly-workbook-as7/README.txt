The examples in this directory are a compliment to the O'Reilly "RESTful Java with JAX-RS" book.  This book has
a detailed explanation of REST and JAX-RS.  The appendix of the book also walks through all the example code provided within
this directory.

You can buy this book at:

The author, Bill Burke, is the founder of the RESTEasy project.

A few users have asked me to port the O'Reilly examples to work with AS7.  The differences are really in the Maven pom.xml file.  You will have to manually start JBoss AS 7 before running each example.
