    <para>
        RESTEasy is installed and configured in different ways depending on which environment you are running in.
        If you are running in JBoss AS 6-M4 (milestone 4) or higher, resteasy is already bundled and integrated
        completely
        so there is very little you have to do. If you are running in a different distribution, there is some manual
        installation and configuration you will have to do.

            Resteasy is bundled with JBoss AS 7.  You will likely have the need to upgrade Resteasy in AS7.  The Resteasy
            distribution comes with a zip file called resteasy-jboss-modules-3.0.2.Final.zip.  Unzip this file while
            with the modules/ directory of the JBoss AS7 distribution.  This will overwrite some of the existing files there.

            RESTEasy is bundled with JBoss/Wildfly and completely integrated as per the requirements of Java EE 6.
            First you must at least provide an empty web.xml file.  You can of course deploy any custom servlet, filter
            or security constraint you want to within your web.xml, but the least amount of work is to create an empty
            web.xml file.  Also, resteasy context-params are available if you want to tweak turn on/off any specific
            resteasy feature.

            Resteasy and JAX-RS are automically loaded into your deployment's classpath, if and only if you are deploying
            a JAX-RS Application.  If you only want to use the client library, you will have to create a dependency
            for it within your deployment.  Also, only some resteasy features are automatically loaded.  To bring
            in these libraries, you'll have to create a jboss-deployment-structure.xml file within your WEB-INF
            directory of your WAR file.  Here's an example:

        <title>Standalone Resteasy</title>
        <para>
            If you are using resteasy outside of JBoss/Wildfly, you will need to do a few manual steps to install and
            configure resteasy.
            RESTeasy is deployed as a WAR archive and thus depends on a Servlet container. We strongly suggest that you
            use Maven to build your WAR files as RESTEasy is split into
            a bunch of different modules. You can see an example Maven project in one of the examples in the examples/
            directory
        </para>
        <para>
            Also, when you download RESTeasy and unzip it you will see a lib/ directory that contains the libraries
            needed by resteasy.
            Copy these into your /WEB-INF/lib directory. Place your JAX-RS annotated class resources and providers
            within
            one or more jars within /WEB-INF/lib or your raw class files within /WEB-INF/classes.
        </para>
        <para>
            RESTeasy is implemented as a Servlet and deployed within a WAR file. If you open up the WEB-INF/web.xml in
            one of the example projects of your RESTeasy download you will see this:

        <para>
            The initialization of RESTEasy can be performed within a ServletContextListener instead of within the
            Servlet. You may need this if you are writing custom Listeners that need to interact with RESTEasy at boot
            time. An example of this is the RESTEasy Spring integration that requires a Spring ServletContextListener.
            The org.jboss.resteasy.plugins.server.servlet.ResteasyBootstrap class is a ServletContextListener that
            configures an instance of an ResteasyProviderFactory and Registry. You can obtain instances of a
            ResteasyProviderFactory and Registry from the ServletContext attributes
            org.jboss.resteasy.spi.ResteasyProviderFactory and org.jboss.resteasy.spi.Registry. From these instances you
            can programmatically interact with RESTEasy registration interfaces.

        <title>RESTEasy as a servlet Filter</title>

        <para>
            The downside of running Resteasy as a Servlet is that you cannot have static resources like .html and .jpeg
            files in the
            same path as your JAX-RS services. Resteasy allows you to run as a Filter instead. If a JAX-RS resource is
            not
            found under the URL requested, Resteasy will delegate back to the base servlet container to resolve URLs.

            RESTEasy supports logging via java.util.logging, Log4j, or Slf4j.  How it picks which framework to delegate to is
	    expressed in the following algorithm:
        </para>
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>If log4j is in the application's classpath, log4j will be used</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>If slf4j is in the application's classpath, slf4j will be used</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>java.util.logging is the default if neither log4j or slf4j is in the classpath</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>If the servlet context param resteasy.logger.type is set to JUL, LOG4J, or SLF4J will override this default behavior</para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
        <para>
            The logging categories are still a work in progress, but the initial set should make it easier to
            troubleshoot issues. Currently, the framework has defined the following log categories:
