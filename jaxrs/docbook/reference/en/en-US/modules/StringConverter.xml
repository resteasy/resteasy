   <title>String marshalling for String based @*Param</title>
   <para>@PathParam, @QueryParam, @MatrixParam, @FormParam, and @HeaderParam are represented as strings in a raw
      HTTP request. The specification says that these types of injected parameters can be converted to objects
      if these objects have a valueOf(String) static method or a constructor that takes one String parameter.
      What if you have a class where valueOf() or this string constructor doesn't exist or is inappropriate for
      an HTTP request? JAX-RS 2.0 has the javax.ws.rs.ext.ParamConverterProvider to help in this situation.
       See javadoc for more details.
