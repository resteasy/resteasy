   <para>
      Asynchronous HTTP Request Processing is a relatively new technique that allows you to process a single HTTP
      request using non-blocking I/O and, if desired in separate threads. Some refer to it as COMET capabilities.
      The primary use case for Asynchronous HTTP is
      in the case where the client is polling the server for a delayed response. The usual example is an AJAX chat
      client where you want to push/pull from both the client and the server. These scenarios have the client blocking
      a long time on the server’s socket waiting for a new message. What happens in synchronous HTTP where the server is
      blocking on incoming and outgoing I/O is that you end up having a thread consumed per client connection.
      This eats up memory and valuable thread resources. Not such a big deal in 90% of applications (in fact using
      asynchronous processing may actually hurt your performance in most common scenarios), but when you start
      getting a lot of concurrent clients that are blocking like this, there’s a lot of wasted resources and your
      server does not scale that well.

        The JAX-RS 2.0 specification has added asynchronous HTTP support via three classes.  The @Suspend annotation,
      AsynchronousResponse interface, and the ExecutionContext interface.

   <para>
       Injection an AsynchronousResponse as a parameter to your jax-rs methods or obtaining it by calling one of the
       ExecutionContext.suspend() methods tells Resteasy that the HTTP request/response should be detached from the currently
      executing thread and that the current thread should not try to automatically process the response.
   </para>
   <para>
      The AsynchronousResponse is the callback object.
      The act of calling one of the resume() methods will cause a response to be sent back to the client and will also terminate the
      HTTP request. Here is an example of asynchronous processing:

   <programlisting>
import javax.ws.rs.Suspend;
import javax.ws.rs.core.AsynchronousResponse;

@Path("/")
public class SimpleResource
{

   @GET
   @Path("basic")
   @Produces("text/plain")
   @Suspend(timeOut=10000)
   public void getBasic(final AsynchronousResponse response) throws Exception
   {
      Thread t = new Thread()
      {
         @Override
         public void run()
         {
            try
            {
               Response jaxrs = Response.ok("basic").type(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN).build();
               response.resume(jaxrs);
            }
            catch (Exception e)
            {
               e.printStackTrace();
            }
         }
      };
      t.start();
   }
}
   </programlisting>
    <para>
        AsynchronousResponse also has other methods to cancel the execution.  See javadoc for more details.

        NOTE: The old Resteasy proprietary API for async http has been deprecated and may be removed as soon as Resteasy 3.1.
