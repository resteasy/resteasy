            ClientRequest.getHeaders() always returns a copy. It also converts the values within
            ClientRequest.getHeadersAsObjects() to string. If you
            add values to the map returned by getHeaders() nothing happen. Instead add values to the
            getHeadersAsObjects() map. This allows non-string header objects
            to propagate through the MessageBodyWriter interceptor and ClientExecutor interceptor chains.

            Slf4j is no longer the default logging mechanism for resteasy. Resteasy also no longer ships with SLF4J
            libraries. Please read the logging

            The constructor used to instantiate resource and provider classes is now picked based on the requirements of
            the JAX-RS specification.
            Specifically, the public constructor with the most arguments is picked. This behavior varies from previous
            versions where a no-arg
            constructor is preferred.

                There is a new Filter implementation that is the preferred deployment mechanism. Servlet-based
                deployments are still supported, but it is suggested you use to using a FilterDispatcher. See

                As per required by the spec List or array injection of empty values will return an empty collection
                or array, not null. I.e.
                (@QueryParam("name") List&lt;String&gt; param) param will be an empty List. Resteasy 1.2.x and
                earlier would return null.

                We have forked TJWS, the servlet container used for embedded testing into the group
                org.jboss.resteasy, with the artifact id of tjws. You will need
                to remove these dependencies from your maven builds if you are using any part of the resteasy
                embebbable server. TJWS has a number of startup/shutdown
                race conditions we had to fix in order to make unit testing viable.

        Methods @Deprecated within 1.2.GA have been removed. This is in the Client Framework and has to do with all

                The constructors for ClientRequest that have a HttpClient parameter (Apache Http Client 3.1 API) are
                now deprecated. They will be removed in the final release of 1.2. You must create a Apache hTTP
                Client Executor and pass it in as a parameter if you want to re-use existing Apache HttpClient
                sessions or do any special configuration. The same is true for the ProxyFactoyr methods.

                Apache HttpClient 4.0 is now the default client used for our ClientRequest and ProxyFactory APIs.  Version 3.1 of this library is still support.  Just allocate an executor for that instead.  Or you can set the default one used by modifying the static field ClientRequest.defaultExecutorClass.

                Apache HttpClient 4.0 support is available if you want to use it. I've had some trouble with it so
                it is not the default implementation yet for the client framework.

                It is no longer required to call RegisterBuiltin.register() to initialize the set of providers. Too
                many users forgot to do this (include myself!). You can turn this off by calling the static method
                ResteasyProviderFactory.setRegisterBuiltinByDefault(false)
