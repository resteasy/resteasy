   <title>Asynchronous HTTP Request Processing</title>
   <para>
      Asynchronous HTTP Request Processing is a relatively new technique that allows you to process a single HTTP
      request using non-blocking I/O and, if desired in separate threads. Some refer to it as COMET capabilities.
      The primary usecase for Asynchronous HTTP is
      in the case where the client is polling the server for a delayed response. The usual example is an AJAX chat
      client where you want to push/pull from both the client and the server. These scenarios have the client blocking
      a long time on the server’s socket waiting for a new message. What happens in synchronous HTTP where the server is
      blocking on incoming and outgoing I/O is that you end up having a thread consumed per client connection.
      This eats up memory and valuable thread resources. Not such a big deal in 90% of applications (in fact using
      asynchronous processing make actually hurt your performance in most common scenaiors), but when you start
      getting a lot of concurrent clients that are blocking like this, there’s a lot of wasted resources and your
      server does not scale that well.

   <para>
      Tomcat, Jetty, and JBoss Web all have similar, but proprietary support for asynchronout HTTP request processing.
      This functionality is currently being standardized in the Servlet 3.0 specification. Resteasy provides a very
      simple callback API to provide asynchronous capabilities. Resteasy currently supports integration with Servlet 3.0
      (through Jetty 7), Tomcat 6, and JBoss Web 2.1.1.
   </para>
   <para>
      The Resteasy asychronous HTTP support is implemented via two classes. The @Suspend annotation and the
      AsynchronousResponse interface.
   </para>
   <programlisting>
public @interface Suspend
{
   long value() default -1;
}

import javax.ws.rs.core.Response;

public interface AsynchronousResponse
{
   void setResponse(Response response);
}
   </programlisting>
   <para>
      The @Suspend annotation tells Resteasy that the HTTP request/response should be detached from the currently
      executing thread and that the current thread should not try to automaticaly process the response. The
      argument to @Suspend is a timeout in milliseconds until the request will be cancelled.
   </para>
   <para>
      The AsynchronousResponse is the callback object. It is injected into the method by Resteasy.
      Application code hands off the AsynchronousResponse to a different thread for processing.
      The act of calling setResponse() will cause a response to be sent back to the client and will also terminate the
      HTTP request. Here is an example of asynchronous processing:

import org.jboss.resteasy.annotations.Suspend;
import org.jboss.resteasy.spi.AsynchronousResponse;

@Path("/")
public class SimpleResource
{

   @GET
   @Path("basic")
   @Produces("text/plain")
   public void getBasic(final @Suspend(10000) AsynchronousResponse response) throws Exception
   {
      Thread t = new Thread()
      {
         @Override
         public void run()
         {
            try
            {
               Response jaxrs = Response.ok("basic").type(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN).build();
               response.setResponse(jaxrs);
            }
            catch (Exception e)
            {
               e.printStackTrace();
            }
         }
      };
      t.start();

         To use Resteasy's Asynchronous HTTP apis with Tomcat 6 or JBoss 4.2.3, you must use a special Restasy Servlet
         and
         configure Tomcat (or JBoss Web in JBoss 4.2.3) to use the NIO transport. First edit Tomcat's (or JBoss Web's)
         server.xml file. Comment out the vanilla HTTP adapter and add this:

      <para>
         Your deployed Resteasy applications must also use a different Resteasy servlet,
         org.jboss.resteasy.plugins.server.servlet.Tomcat6CometDispatcherServlet. This class is available
         within the async-http-tomcat-xxx.jar or within the Maven repository under the

           There's also a Filter30Dispatcher class if you want to use Resteasy as a filter.  If you are running within
           JBoss AS 6 M4 or higher, you do not have to add this config to your web.xml if you are relying on the app
           server to do automatic scanning and have web.xml empty.
