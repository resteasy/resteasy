   <title>JAX-RS Content Negotiation</title>

   <para>

      The HTTP protocol has built in content negotiation headers that allow the client and server to specify what
      content they are transferring and what content they would prefer to get. The server declares content preferences
      via the @Produces and @Consumes headers.
   </para>
   <para>


      @Consumes is an array of media types that a particular resource or resource method consumes. For example:
   </para>
   <para>

<programlisting>
@Consumes("text/*")
@Path("/library")
public class Library {

    @POST
    public String stringBook(String book) {...}

    @Consumes("text/xml")
    @POST
    public String jaxbBook(Book book) {...}
}
</programlisting>
   </para>
   <para>

      When a client makes a request, JAX-RS first finds all methods that match the path, then, it sorts things based on
      the content-type header sent by the client.
      So, if a client sent:
   </para>
   <para>

<programlisting>
POST /library
Content-Type: text/plain

This is a nice book
</programlisting>
   </para>
   <para>

      The stringBook() method would be invoked because it matches to the default &quot;text/*&quot; media type. Now, if
      the client instead sends XML:
   </para>
   <para>

<programlisting>
POST /library
Content-Type: text/xml

&lt;book name="EJB 3.0" author="Bill Burke"/&gt;
</programlisting>
   </para>
   <para>

      The jaxbBook() method would be invoked.
   </para>
   <para>


      The @Produces is used to map a client request and match it up to the client's Accept header. The Accept HTTP
      header is sent by the client and defines the media types the client prefers to receive from the server.
   </para>
   <para>


<programlisting>
@Produces("text/*")
@Path("/library")
public class Library {

@GET
@Produces("application/json")
public String getJSON() {...}

@GET
public String get() {...}
</programlisting>
   </para>
   <para>

      So, if the client sends:
   </para>
   <para>

<programlisting>
GET /library
Accept: application/json
</programlisting>
   </para>
   <para>

      The getJSON() method would be invoked.
   </para>
   <para>


      @Consumes and @Produces can list multiple media types that they support. The client's Accept header can also send
      multiple types it might like to receive. More specific media types are chosen first. The client Accept header or
      @Produces @Consumes can also specify weighted preferences that are used to match up requests with resource
      methods. This is best explained by RFC 2616 section 14.1 . RESTEasy supports this complex way of doing content
      negotiation.
   </para>
   <para>


   </para>
   <para>

      A variant in JAX-RS is a combination of media type, content-language, and content encoding as well as etags, last
      modified headers, and other preconditions. This is a more complex form of content negotiation that is done
      programmatically by the application developer using the javax.ws.rs.Variant, VarianListBuilder, and Request
      objects. Request is injected via @Context. Read the javadoc for more info on these.

<sect1 id="media_mappings">
<title>URL-based negotiation</title>
<para>
Some clients, like browsers, cannot use the Accept and Accept-Language headers to negotiation the representation's media type
or language.  RESTEasy allows you to map file name suffixes like (.xml, .txt, .en, .fr) to media types and languages.  These file name suffixes
take the place and override any Accept header sent by the client.  You configure this using the resteasy.media.type.mappings and resteasy.language.mappings
context-param variables within your web.xml.

        <param-value>en : en-US, es : es, fr : fr</param-value>
   </context-param>

   ...
</web-app>]]>
</programlisting>
<para>
Mappings are a comma delimited list of suffix/mediatype or suffix/language mappings.  Each mapping is delimited by a ':'.  So, if you invoked GET /foo/bar.xml.en, this would be equivalent to invoking the following request:
</para>
<programlisting>
GET /foo/bar
Accept: application/xml
Accept-Language: en-US
</programlisting>
<para>
The mapped file suffixes are stripped from the target URL path before the request is dispatched to a corresponding JAX-RS resource.
</para>

<sect1 id="param_media_mappings">
<title>Query String Parameter-based negotiation</title>
<para>
RESTEasy can do content negotiation based in a parameter in query string. To enable this, the web.xml can be configured like follow:
</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
<web-app>
    <display-name>Archetype Created Web Application</display-name>
    <context-param>
        <param-name>resteasy.media.type.param.mapping</param-name>
        <param-value>someName</param-value>
    </context-param>

    ...
</web-app>]]>
</programlisting>
<para>The param-value is the name of the query string parameter that RESTEasy will use in the place of the Accept header.</para>
<para>Invoking http://service.foo.com/resouce?someName=application/xml, will give the application/xml media type the highest priority in the content negotiation.</para>
<para>In cases where the request contains both the parameter and the Accept header, the parameter will be more relevant.</para>
<para>It is possible to left the param-value empty, what will cause the processor to look for a parameter named 'accept'.</para>
