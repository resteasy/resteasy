    <para>JAX-RS 2.1 adds more asynchronous processing support in both the
        Client and the Server API.  The specification adds a Reactive programming
        style to the Client side and Server-Sent Events (SSE) protocol support to
        both client and server.

        <para>The specification defines a new type of invoker named RxInvoker, and a default

            CompletionStageRxInvoker implements Java 8's interface CompletionStage.
            This interface declares a large number of methods dedicated to managing
            asynchronous computations.

        <para>
             SSE is part of HTML standard, currently supported by many browsers. 
             It is a server push technology, which provides a way to establish 
             a one-way channel to continuously send data to clients. SSE events are pushed 
             to the client via a long-running HTTP connection.
             In case of lost connection, clients can retrieve missed events by setting a
             "Last-Event-ID" HTTP header in a new request.
        </para>
        <para> 
             SSE stream has text/event-stream media type and contains multiple SSE events. 
             SSE event is a data structure encoded with UTF-8 and contains fields and comment. 
             The field can be event, data, id, retry and other kinds of field will be ignored.
        </para>
        <para>
             From JAX-RS 2.1, Server-sent Events APIs are introduced to support sending, receiving and broadcasting SSE events.

            <para>
              As shown in the following example, a SSE resource method has the text/event-stream produce 
              media type and an injected context parameter SseEventSink. The injected SseEventSink is 
              the connected SSE stream where events can be sent. Another injected context Sse is an 
              entry point for creating and broadcasting SSE events. Here is an example to 
              demonstrate how to send SSE events every 200ms and close the stream after a "done" event.

            <para>
               With SseBroadcaster, SSE events can be broadcasted to multiple clients simultaneously. 
               It will iterate over all registered SseEventSinks and send events to all requested SSE Stream.  
               An application can create a SseBroadcaster from an injected context Sse. The broadcast 
               method on a SseBroadcaster is used to send SSE events to all registered clients.
               The following code snippet is an example on how to create SseBroadcaster, subscribe 
               and broadcast events to all subscribed consumers.

            <title>SSE Client</title>
            <para>
                SseEventSource is the entry point to read and process incoming SSE events. 
                A SseEventSource instance can be initialized with a WebTarget. Once SseEventSource 
                is created and connected to a server, registered event consumer will be invoked when 
                an inbound event arrives. In case of errors, an exception will be passed 
                to a registered consumer so that it can be processed. SseEventSource can automatically reconnect the server 
                and continuously receive pushed events after the connection has been lost. SseEventSource 
                can send lastEventId to the server by default when it is reconnected, and server may use 
                this id to replay all missed events. But reply event is really upon on SSE resource 
                method implementation.  If the server responds HTTP 503 with a RETRY_AFTER header, 
                SseEventSource will automatically schedule a reconnect task with this RETRY_AFTER 
                value. The following code snippet is to create a SseEventSource and print the 
                inbound event data value and error if it happens.

        <title>Java API for JSON Binding</title>
        <para>
            RESTEasy supports both JSON-B and JSON-P.  In accordance with the specification,
            entity providers for JSON-B take precedence over those for JSON-P for all types
            except JsonValue and its sub-types.
        </para>
        <para>
            The support for JSON-B is provided by the <code>JsonBindingProvider</code> from <code>resteasy-json-binding-provider</code> module.
            To satisfy JAX-RS 2.1 requirements, JsonBindingProvider takes precedence over the other providers for dealing with JSON payloads,
            in particular the Jackson one. The JSON outputs (for the same input) from Jackson and JSON-B reference implementation can be slightly
            different.  As a consequence, in order to allow retaining backward compatibility, RESTEasy offers a
            <code>resteasy.preferJacksonOverJsonB</code> context property that can be set to <code>true</code> to disable JsonBindingProvider
            for the current deloyment.
        </para>
        <para>
            WildFly 14 supports specifying the default value for the <code>resteasy.preferJacksonOverJsonB</code> context property by setting
            a system property with the same name. Moreover, if no value is set for the context and system properties, it scans &REST-API; deployments
            for Jackson annotations and sets the property to <code>true</code> if any of those annotations is found.

        <title>JSON Patch and JSON Merge Patch</title>
        <para>
            RESTEasy supports apply partial modification to target resource with JSON Patch/JSON Merge Patch.
            Instead of sending json request which represents the whole modified resource with HTTP PUT method, the json request only
            contains the modified part with HTTP PATCH method can do the same job.
        </para>
        <para>
            JSON Patch request has an array of json object and each JSON object gives the operation to execute against the target resource.
            Here is an example to modify the target Student resource which has these fields and values:
            {"firstName":"Alice","id":1,"school":"MiddleWood School"}:
                <programlisting><![CDATA[
            PATCH /StudentPatchTest/students/1 HTTP/1.1
            Content-Type: application/json-patch+json
            Content-Length: 184
            Host: localhost:8090
            Connection: Keep-Alive

            [{"op":"copy","from":"/firstName","path":"/lastName"},
             {"op":"replace","path":"/firstName","value":"John"},
             {"op":"remove","path":"/school"},
             {"op":"add","path":"/gender","value":"male"}]
                 ]]>
                </programlisting>
            This JSON Patch request will copy the firstName to lastName field , then change the firstName value to "John".
            The next operation is remove the school value and add male gender to this "id=1" student resource.
            After this JSON Path is applied, the target resource will be modified to:
             {"firstName":"John","gender":"male","id":1,"lastName":"Taylor"}.
            The operation keyword here can be "add", "remove", "replace", "move", "copy", or "test". The "path" value
            must be a JSON Pointer value to point the part to apply this JSON Patch.
        </para>
        <para>
            Unlike use the operation keyword to patch the target resource, JSON Merge Patch request directly send the expect
            json change and RestEasy merge this change to target resource which identified by the request URI. Like the below JSON Merge Patch request, it remove
            the "school" value and change the "firstName" to "Green". This is much straightforward:
            <programlisting><![CDATA[
             PATCH /StudentPatchTest/students/1 HTTP/1.1

             Host: localhost:8090
             Connection: Keep-Alive
