JAX-RS 2.0 (JSR-339) and JAX-RS 2.1 (JSR-370), are JCP specifications that provide a Java API for RESTful Web Services over the HTTP protocol.
Beginning in 2017, Oracle donated Java Enterprise Edition to the Eclipse Foundation, where Java EE evolved into Jakarta EE. In the process,
JAX-RS evolved into the <ulink url="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/restful-ws/">Jakarta RESTFul Web Services</ulink> project. The
shortened phrase "Jakarta REST" is frequently used in practice, and in this Guide, we generally use "Jakarta REST" where once we used "JAX-RS". Occasionally,
we still refer to JAX-RS in an historical context.

    RESTEasy is a portable implementation of these specifications which can run in any Servlet container. Tighter
    integration with WildFly application server is also available to make the user experience nicer in that environment.
    RESTEasy also comes with additional features on top of plain Jakarta REST functionalities.
