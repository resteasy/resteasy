    <para>
        RESTEasy is installed and configured in different ways depending on which environment you are running in.
        If you are running in WildFly, RESTEasy is already bundled and integrated completely
        so there is very little you have to do. If you are running in a different environment, there is some manual
        installation and configuration you will have to do.

        <title>RESTEasy modules in WildFly</title>
        <para>
            In WildFly, RESTEasy and the JAX-RS API are automatically loaded into your deployment's classpath
            if and only if you are deploying a JAX-RS application (as determined by the presence
            of JAX-RS annotations). However, only some RESTEasy features are automatically loaded. See Table 3.1. 
            If you need any of those libraries which are not loaded automatically, you'll have to bring them in
            with a jboss-deployment-structure.xml file in the WEB-INF directory of your WAR file.  Here's an example:  
        </para>
        <programlisting><![CDATA[
<jboss-deployment-structure>
    <deployment>
        <dependencies>
            <module name="org.jboss.resteasy.resteasy-jackson-provider" services="import"/>
        </dependencies>
    </deployment>
</jboss-deployment-structure>]]></programlisting>
        <para>The <literal>services</literal> attribute must be set to "import" for modules that have default providers
            in a META-INF/services/javax.ws.rs.ext.Providers file. 
        </para>
        <para>
            To get an idea of which RESTEasy modules are loaded by default when JAX-RS services are deployed, please
            see the table below, which refers to a recent WildFly ditribution patched with the current RESTEasy
            distribution. Clearly, future and unpatched WildFly distributions might differ a bit in terms of modules
            enabled by default, as the container actually controls this too.

        <title>Deploying a RESTEasy application to WildFly</title>
        <para>
            RESTEasy is bundled with WildFly and completely integrated as per the requirements of Java EE.
            You can use it with EJB and CDI and you can rely completely on WildFly to scan for and deploy your JAX-RS services and providers.
            All you have to provide is your JAX-RS service and provider classes packaged
            within a WAR either as POJOs, CDI beans, or EJBs.
            A simple way to configure an application is by simply providing an empty web.xml file.
            You can of course deploy any custom servlet, filter
            or security constraint you want to within your web.xml, but none of them are required:

        <para>
            Since we're not using a &lt;servlet-mapping&gt; element, we must define a
            <classname>javax.ws.rs.core.Application</classname> class (see <xref linkend="javax.ws.rs.core.Application"/>) that is annotated with
            the <classname>javax.ws.rs.ApplicationPath</classname> annotation.  If you return any empty set for classes and singletons,
            which is the behavior inherited from <classname>Application</classname>, your WAR will
            be scanned for resource and provider classes as indicated by the presence of JAX-RS annotations.

            Of course, even in this case it can be used to specify additional information such as context parameters.
            If there is an <classname>Application</classname> class but it doesn't have an 
            <classname>@ApplicationPath</classname> annotation, then a web.xml file with at least a
            &lt;servlet-mapping&gt; element is required.

        <para>
            If you are using RESTEasy outside of WildFly, in a standalone servlet container like Tomcat or Jetty, for example,
            you will need to include the appropriate RESTEasy jars in your WAR file.  You will need the core classes
            in the resteasy-jaxrs module, and you may need additional facilities like the resteasy-jaxb-provider module.
            We strongly suggest that you use Maven to build your WAR files as RESTEasy is split into
            a bunch of different modules:

            If you are not using Maven, you can include the necessary jars by hand. If you download
            RESTEasy (from <ulink url="http://resteasy.jboss.org/downloads.html">http://resteasy.jboss.org/downloads.html</ulink>,
            for example) you will get a file like resteasy-jaxrs-&lt;version&gt;-all.zip.             
            If you unzip it you will see a lib/ directory that contains the libraries needed by RESTEasy.
            Copy these, as needed, into your /WEB-INF/lib directory. Place your JAX-RS annotated class resources and providers
            within one or more jars within /WEB-INF/lib or your raw class files within /WEB-INF/classes.

            RESTEasy uses the <literal>ServletContainerInitializer</literal> integration interface in Servlet 3.0 containers
            to initialize an application, automatically scanning for resources and providers. To enable automatic
            scanning, you must also include the <literal>resteasy-servlet-initializer</literal> artifact in your WAR
            file as well:

            The <literal>resteasy-servlet-initializer</literal> artifact will not work in Servlet versions older than
            3.0.  You'll then have to manually declare the RESTEasy servlet in your WEB-INF/web.xml file of your WAR project,
            and you'll have to use an <classname>Application</classname> class (see <xref linkend="javax.ws.rs.core.Application"/>)
            which explicitly lists resources and providers. For example:

            This section is pretty much deprecated if you are using a Servlet 3.0 container or higher.  Skip it if
            you are and read the configuration section above on installing in Servlet 3.0.
            The initialization of RESTEasy can be performed within a ServletContextListener instead of within the
            Servlet. You may need this if you are writing custom Listeners that need to interact with RESTEasy at boot
            time. An example of this is the RESTEasy Spring integration that requires a Spring ServletContextListener.
            The org.jboss.resteasy.plugins.server.servlet.ResteasyBootstrap class is a ServletContextListener that
            configures an instance of an ResteasyProviderFactory and Registry. You can obtain instances of a
            ResteasyProviderFactory and Registry from the ServletContext attributes
            org.jboss.resteasy.spi.ResteasyProviderFactory and org.jboss.resteasy.spi.Registry. From these instances you
            can programmatically interact with RESTEasy registration interfaces.

            The downside of running RESTEasy as a Servlet is that you cannot have static resources like .html and .jpeg
            files in the
            same path as your JAX-RS services. RESTEasy allows you to run as a Filter instead. If a JAX-RS resource is
            not
            found under the URL requested, RESTEasy will delegate back to the base servlet container to resolve URLs.

        communicating with restful applications. In RESTEasy, the minimal set of modules needed for the client framework
        consists of resteasy-jaxrs and resteasy-client. You can access them by way of maven:
