    <title>JSON Support via Jakarta EE JSON-P API</title>
    <para>No, this is not the JSONP you are thinking of! JSON-P is a Jakarta EE parsing API.
        Horrible name for
        a new JSON parsing API!  What were they thinking?  Anyways, RESTEasy has
        a provider for it.  If you are using WildFly, it is required by Jakarta EE so you will have it automatically bundled.
        Otherwise, use this maven dependency.

    <para>
        It has built in support for JsonObject, JsonArray, and JsonStructure as request or response entities.  It should
        not conflict with Jackson if you have that in your path too.
