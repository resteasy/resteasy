   <title>Asynchronous Job Service</title>
   <para>
      The RESTEasy Asynchronous Job Service is an implementation of the Asynchronous Job pattern defined in O'Reilly's "Restful Web Services" book.  The idea of it is to bring asynchronicity to a synchronous protocol.

     <title>Using Async Jobs</title>
      <para>While HTTP is a synchronous protocol
      it does have a faint idea of asynchronous invocations.  The HTTP 1.1 response code 202, "Accepted" means that the server
      has received and accepted the response for processing, but the processing has not yet been completed.  The RESTEasy 
      Asynchronous Job Service builds around this idea.
   </para>
<programlisting>
POST http://example.com/myservice?asynch=true
</programlisting>
   <para>
    For example, if you make the above post with the asynch query parameter set to true, RESTEasy will return a 202, "Accepted" response code and run the invocation in the background.  It also sends back a Location header with a URL pointing to where the response of the background method is located.
   </para>
<programlisting>
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Location: http://example.com/asynch/jobs/3332334
</programlisting>
   <para>
   The URI will have the form of:
   </para>
<programlisting>
/asynch/jobs/{job-id}?wait={millisconds}|nowait=true
</programlisting>
   <para>You can perform the GET, POST, and DELETE operations on this job URL.  GET returns whatever the JAX-RS resource method you invoked
   returned as a response if the job was completed.  If the job has not completed, this GET will return a response code of 202, Accepted.  Invoking GET does not remove the job, so you can call it multiple times.  When RESTEasy's job queue gets full, it will evict
the least recently used job from memory.  You can manually clean up after yourself by calling DELETE on the URI.  POST does
a read of the JOB response and will remove the JOB it has been completed.
</para>
   <para>Both GET and POST allow you to specify a maximum
wait time in milliseconds, a "wait" query parameter.  Here's an example:
</para>
<programlisting>
POST http://example.com/asynch/jobs/122?wait=3000
</programlisting>
   <para>  If you do not specify a "wait" parameter, the GET or POST will not wait at all if the job is not complete.</para>
   <para>  NOTE!!  While you can invoke GET, DELETE, and PUT methods asynchronously, this breaks the HTTP 1.1 contract of these methods.  While these invocations may not change the state of the resource if invoked more than once, they do change the state of the server as new Job entries with each invocation.  If you want to be a purist, stick with only invoking POST methods asynchronously.
   </para>
   <para> Security NOTE!  RESTEasy role-based security (annotations) does not work with the Asynchronous Job Service.  You must use
   XML declarative security within your web.xml file. Why? It is impossible to implement role-based security portably.  In the future, we may have specific JBoss integration, but will not support other environments.</para>
   <para>NOTE. A <classname>SecureRandom</classname> object is used to generate unique job ids. For security purposes, the
   <classname>SecureRandom</classname> is periodically reseeded. By default, it is reseeded after 100 uses. This value
   may be configured with the servlet init parameter "resteasy.secure.random.max.use".
   </para>

   <sect1 id="oneway">
      <title>Oneway: Fire and Forget</title>
      <para>
         RESTEasy also supports the notion of fire and forget.  This will also return a 202, Accepted response, but no Job will
         be created.  This is as simple as using the oneway query parameter instead of asynch.  For example:
      </para>
<programlisting>
POST http://example.com/myservice?oneway=true
</programlisting>
   <para> Security NOTE!  RESTEasy role-based security (annotations) does not work with the Asynchronous Job Service.  You must use
   XML declaritive security within your web.xml file. Why? It is impossible to implement role-based security portably.  In the future, we may have specific JBoss integration, but will not support other environments.</para>
