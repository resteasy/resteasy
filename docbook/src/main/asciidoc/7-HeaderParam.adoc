TIP:

RESTEasy link:/13-Improved-Param-annotations.html[supports @HeaderParam annotations with no parameter name]
====

The @HeaderParam annotation allows you to map a request HTTP header to your method invocation.

GET /books?num=5

----
@GET
public String getBooks(@HeaderParam("From") String from) {
...
}
----

Like PathParam, your parameter type can be an String, primitive, or class that has a String constructor or static valueOf() method. For example, MediaType has a valueOf() method and you could do:

----
@PUT
public void put(@HeaderParam("Content-Type") MediaType contentType, ...)

= 7.1. HeaderDelegates

In addition to the usual methods for translating parameters to and from strings, parameters annotated with @HeaderParam have another option: implementations of RuntimeDelegate$HeaderDelegate:

----
/**
     * Defines the contract for a delegate that is responsible for
     * converting between the String form of a HTTP header and
     * the corresponding Jakarta RESTful Web Services type {@code T}.
     *
     * @param <T> a Jakarta RESTful Web Services type that corresponds to the value of a HTTP header.
     */
    public static interface HeaderDelegate<T> {

        /**
         * Parse the supplied value and create an instance of {@code T}.
         *
         * @param value the string value.
         * @return the newly created instance of {@code T}.
         * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the supplied string cannot be
         *                                  parsed or is {@code null}.
         */
        public T fromString(String value);

        /**
         * Convert the supplied value to a String.
         *
         * @param value the value of type {@code T}.
         * @return a String representation of the value.
         * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the supplied object cannot be
         *                                  serialized or is {@code null}.
         */
        public String toString(T value);
    }
----

HeaderDelegate is similar to ParamConverter, but it is not very convenient to register a HeaderDelegate since, unlike, for example, ParamConverterProvider, it is not treated by the Jakarta RESTful Web Services specification as a provider. The class jakarta.ws.rs.core.Configurable, which is subclassed by, for example, org.jboss.resteasy.spi.ResteasyProviderFactory has methods like

----
/**
     * Register a class of a custom Jakarta RESTful Web Services component (such as an extension provider or
     * a {@link jakarta.ws.rs.core.Feature feature} meta-provider) to be instantiated
     * and used in the scope of this configurable context.
     *
     * ...
     *
     * @param componentClass Jakarta RESTful Web Services component class to be configured in the scope of this
     *                       configurable context.
     * @return the updated configurable context.
     */
    public C register(Class<?> componentClass);
----

but it is not clear that they are applicable to HeaderDelegates.

RESTEasy approaches this problem by allowing HeaderDelegates to be annotated with @Provider. Not only will ResteasyProviderFactory.register() process HeaderDelegates, but another useful consequence is that HeaderDelegates can be discovered automatically at runtime.
