= 49.1. Using CDI beans as Jakarta RESTful Web Services components

Both the Jakarta RESTful Web Services and CDI specifications introduce their own component model. On the one hand, every class placed in a CDI archive that fulfills a set of basic constraints is implicitly a CDI bean. On the other hand, explicit decoration of your Java class with @Path or @Provider is required for it to become a Jakarta RESTful Web Services component. Without the integration code, annotating a class suitable for being a CDI bean with Jakarta RESTful Web Services annotations leads into a faulty result (Jakarta RESTful Web Services component not managed by CDI) The resteasy-cdi module is a bridge that allows RESTEasy to work with class instances obtained from the CDI container.

During a web service invocation, resteasy-cdi asks the CDI container for the managed instance of a Jakarta RESTful Web Services component. Then, this instance is passed to RESTEasy. If a managed instance is not available for some reason (the class is placed in a jar which is not a bean deployment archive), RESTEasy falls back to instantiating the class itself.

As a result, CDI services like injection, lifecycle management, events, decoration and interceptor bindings can be used in Jakarta RESTful Web Services components.

= 49.2. Default scopes

A CDI bean that does not explicitly define a scope is @Dependent scoped by default. This pseudo scope means that the bean adapts to the lifecycle of the bean it is injected into. Normal scopes (request, session, application) are more suitable for Jakarta RESTful Web Services components as they designate component's lifecycle boundaries explicitly. Therefore, the resteasy-cdi module alters the default scoping in the following way:

* If a Jakarta RESTful Web Services root resource does not define a scope explicitly, it is bound to the Request scope.
* If a Jakarta RESTful Web Services Provider or jakarta.ws.rs.Application subclass does not define a scope explicitly, it is bound to the Application scope.

====
WARNING:

Since the scope of all beans that do not declare a scope is modified by resteasy-cdi, this affects session beans as well. As a result, a conflict occurs if the scope of a stateless session bean or singleton is changed automatically as the spec prohibits these components to be @RequestScoped. Therefore, you need to explicitly define a scope when using stateless session beans or singletons. This requirement is likely to be removed in future releases.

= 49.3. Configuration within WildFly

CDI integration is provided with no additional configuration with WildFly.


[[anchor-3104]]
= 49.4. Configuration with different distributions

Provided you have an existing RESTEasy application, all that needs to be done is to add the resteasy-cdi jar into your project's WEB-INF/lib directory. When using maven, this can be achieve by defining the following dependency.

----
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.jboss.resteasy</groupId>
	<artifactId>resteasy-cdi</artifactId>
	<version>${project.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

Furthermore, when running a pre-Servlet 3 container, the following context parameter needs to be specified in web.xml. (This is done automatically via web-fragment in a Servlet 3 environment)

----
<context-param>

    <param-name>resteasy.injector.factory</param-name>

    <param-value>org.jboss.resteasy.cdi.CdiInjectorFactory</param-value>

</context-param>
----

When deploying an application to a Servlet container that does not support CDI out of the box (Tomcat, Jetty, Google App Engine), a CDI implementation needs to be added first.
https://docs.jboss.org/weld/reference/latest/en-US/html/environments.html[Weld-servlet module] can be used for this purpose.
